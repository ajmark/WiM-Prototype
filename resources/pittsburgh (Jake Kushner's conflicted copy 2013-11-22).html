               <h2>Neighborhoods</h2>
			
               <h4>Oakland</h4>
            
               <p><img src="../images/forbes_ave_eb_app_univ_of_pittsburgh_01.jpg" alt="forbes_ave_eb_app_univ_of_pittsburgh_01.jpg" class="contentphoto"  />  First-time visitors to Pitt drive right through the heart of Oakland as they approach from the interstate, driving up the hill towards the Cathedral of Learning, passing copy shops, sandwich joints, bars, gas stations, fast food, hotels, several banks, and drug stores.</p>
            
               <h4>Bloomfield</h4>
            
               <p><img src="../images/Lower_Bloomfield_Pittsburgh.JPG" alt="Lower_Bloomfield_Pittsburgh.JPG" class="contentphoto"  /> Bloomfield is a middle-class Italian-German neighborhood that is very quiet and offers affordable housing close to campus (just over 2 miles &#8220;as the crow flies&#8221;). The neighborhood is populated largely by families, and most apartments are in older houses or small apartment buildings. If you are looking to buy a house, homes in Bloomfield go for reasonable prices and have good resale values.</p>
            
               <h4>Shadyside</h4>
            
               <p><img src="../images/shadyside-poodle.jpg" alt="shadyside-poodle.jpg" class="contentphoto"  /> Shadyside offers something for everyone, seriously. It has beautifully restored Victorian mansions and swanky apartments; the convenience of national retail stores such as The Gap and Apple are located adjacent to unique locally owned shops; every type of food and cuisine is accounted for as seen in the plethora of restaurants and trendy eateries.</p>
            
               <h4>South Side</h4>
            
               <p><img src="../images/South_Side_Works_in_Pittsburgh.JPG" alt="South_Side_Works_in_Pittsburgh.JPG" class="contentphoto"  /> East Carson Street literally runs the whole gamut of the South Side, from flashy Station Square to hip and urbane SouthSide Works. In between these two entertainment and shopping destinations, though, lies a unique neighborhood with a crunchy, urban feel.</p>
            
               <h4>Squirrel Hill</h4>
            
               <p><img src="../images/squirrel-hill-21.jpg" alt="squirrel-hill-21.jpg" class="contentphoto" /> Squirrel Hill is the best neighborhood ever. It&#8217;s safe, it&#8217;s clean, and it has Murray Avenue, where you can get groceries, a good book, a haircut, a beer, or one of five buses to campus.</p>
