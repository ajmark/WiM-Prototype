					<br>
          <img id="mission-pic" class="banner" src="../images/women_doctors.jpg">
					<p>Women in Medicine (WiM) is a group at Allegheny Health Network (AHN) comprised of female physicians. AHN brings           together the brightest health care professionals from western Pennsylvania and beyond to form a cost-effective health system that preserves consumer choice for everyone. WiM is a sub-group of the AHN that fosters a supportive and collaborative environment within the Department of Medicine. The organization was co-founded by Elizabeth Cuevas, MD., Kathleen Holleran, MD., and Susan Manzi, MD, MPH. in 2012.</p><br>
            <p>WiM plans to expand across AHN to include hospital departments. We serve as a support and resource system for all of our women physicians.</p><br>
            <p>Our Mission is to provide a professional network for female faculty, fellows, residents, and medical students in the Department of Medicine. The group aims to create a positive environment for female physicians and physicians-in-training that will enhance personal and professional career development through mentorship, service opportunities, speaker series and social events.</p><br>
            <p>Our WiM group hopes that by providing WPAHS with a robust supportive structure that fosters and encourages a flexible and healthy work life balance, the hospital system will be set to recruit and retain the best women physicians in the country.</p>
